I built this app to help me monitor the water tank for my hydroponic garden. This app takes the data stored from a MongoDB database and displays the current readings and graphs the past 7 days on a line chart. The app monitors water temperature, water PPM, room temperature and humidity. 

This app uses an MongoDB/Express/Pug/Node stack. I used Pug because it's what I was familiar with.
